# Development

WP2 (Development and installation of tools ) is designed to accomplish the following:

* Extend, integrate and implement the e-learning platform that will be used to gather the resources of the project, discussion forum for students/staffs. Production of documentation in English and Spanish and also video tutorials. Members of the team will be trained to use the platform by videoconference, how to adapt contents and formats and create new e-learning modules taking into account local settings and target group needs.

* Buying and installation of the required laboratory equipment in each Partner Country HEI. The main ideas are diversification and cost optimization, each laboratory will focus in only one particle detection technique (Resistive Plate Chambers RPCs, Water Cherenkov Detectors WCDs, Scintillators, etc), students, teaching and technical staff will have remote access to the detection system and data will be stored in a central repository. A prototype testbench will be installed to allow students to develop, construct and test data acquisition modules.
